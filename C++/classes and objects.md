# C++ Classes and Objects



## Object

> Object Oriented Programming is a programming style that is intended to make thinking about programming closer to thinking about the real world
>
> objects are independent units, and each has its own identity, just as objects in the real world
>
> it is possible to have two mugs that look identical, but they are still separate, unique objects
>
> object might contain other objects but they're still different objects
>
> three dimensions for OOP: identity, attributes, behavior

* object *characteristics* == **attributes** - describes the current *state* of an object

* in programming, an object is *self-contained*, with its own *identity*. It is separate from other objects
* each object has its own *attributes*, which describe its current state. Each exhibits its own *behavior*, which demonstrates what they can do



## Class

* objects are created using classes, which are the focal point of OOP
* the **class** describes what the object will be, but is separate from the object itself
  * object's blueprint, description, definition
*
