# Python

## GIL
> Global Interpreter Lock
- is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecodes at once.
- this lock is necessary mainly because CPython's memory management is not thread-safe


### Co-Routine
```python
def print_matches(matchtext):
    print("Looking for", matchtext)
    while True:
        line = (yield)
        if matchtext in line:
            print(line)

    match = print_matches('good')
    next(match)
    # Looking for good
    match.send('Python is good')
    # Python is good
    match.close()
```
